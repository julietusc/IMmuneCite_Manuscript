# IMC Methods Paper

Code and data to reproduce the comparison in "IMmuneCite: an open-source workflow for processing multiplex images and analysis of immune enriched spatial proteomic data". Any data not available in this repository can be requested by contacting the corresponding author (see manuscript link below).

IMmuneCite pre-processing and clustering pipelines can be found under the "IMmuneCite_Pipeline" repository at https://github.com/julietusc/IMmuneCite_Pipeline.git

The human data used in this study was also used in one of our previous studies (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adm8841). The data can be found here: https://github.com/julietusc/IMC_liver_rejection_adults.
